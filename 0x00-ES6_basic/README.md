# ES6 Basics

## Variables and Data Types:

* Declare variables using var, let, or const.
+ Common data types include number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object, and symbol.

## Functions:

+ Functions are declared using function keyword or arrow functions (=>).
- They can take parameters and return values.

## Arrays and Objects:

- Arrays store multiple values in a single variable.
+ Objects store key-value pairs.

## Control Flow:

* Use if, else if, else for conditional statements.
for and while loops for iteration.

## DOM Manipulation:

+ JavaScript interacts with HTML through the Document Object Model (DOM).
+ Methods like getElementById, querySelector, addEventListener are used to manipulate DOM elements.

## Asynchronous JavaScript:

+ JavaScript is single-threaded but supports asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.

## Error Handling:

- Use try, catch, and finally blocks to handle exceptions.
Modules and Packages:

* JavaScript uses import and export to organize code into modules.
- Package management is typically done using npm (Node Package Manager).

## ES6+ Features:

- Includes arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, classes, modules, and more.


## Browser Compatibility:

- Consider browser compatibility when using newer JavaScript features or APIs.

## Debugging Tools:

- Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) for debugging JavaScript code.
